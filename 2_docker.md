## Introduction to Docker

I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jqXkkj6D3k) recently, after I got more familiar with Docker. While it is a bit technical at times, I believe it still is one of the best videos in actually explaining Docker (only the first 6 minutes). While it is intended to serve as a supplement to the rest of this section, hopefully my explanations will still provide something of substance.

### Dockerfile

### Docker Compose

### Dockerhub
